        <p>I am building this site with HTML and publishing it through GitHub Pages. This is an entirely new skill for me, and depending on when you're visiting this site, it may look rough. I may post here various projects that I want to share with friends, potential employers, and whoever else may stumble into this domain. Feel free to browse through and see what there is to see!</p>
